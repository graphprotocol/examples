# The Graph - Example Repositories

This repository contains links to example code for products built on The Graph. Each folder under this directory represents a separate example or demo showcasing various features and use-cases.

## Contents

-   **token-api/**
    -   [**token-api-quickstart**](./token-api/token-api-quickstart): Provides examples for integrating The Graph's Token API directly via React and through Cursor MCP. Covers token balances, transfers, and multi-chain support.
    -   [**token-api-scaffold-eth**](./token-api/token-api-scaffold-eth): Demonstrates integrating The Graph's Token API with Scaffold ETH to accelerate development of full-stack decentralized applications.
    -   [**token-api-tax-demo**](./token-api/token-api-tax-demo): Shows how to pull wallet balances, historical inventory, transfers, and price data from The Graph Token API for tax and accounting, using a lightweight HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express proxy.

-   **subgraphs/**
    -   **feature-examples/**
        -   [**subgraph-timeseries-and-aggregations**](./subgraphs/feature-examples/subgraph-timeseries-and-aggregations): Example demonstrating timeseries and aggregations with The Graph, using CryptoPunks events (transfers, bids, sales) to showcase data aggregation over time. Includes a video walkthrough.
    -   **full-stack-examples/**
        -   [**subgraph-full-stack-dapp**](./subgraphs/full-stack-examples/subgraph-full-stack-dapp): A workshop and template for full-stack dapp development using Scaffold-ETH 2 and The Graph. Covers setting up the environment, smart contract deployment, subgraph creation, and frontend integration. Includes a video replay.
    -   **workshops/**
        -   [**subgraph-development-workshop**](./subgraphs/workshops/subgraph-development-workshop): Workshop material for subgraph development and querying. Covers deploying a starter subgraph, understanding key files (manifest, mappings, schema), comparing with a published CryptoPunks subgraph, and extending entities. Includes video and slides.
        -   [**subgraph-file-data-sources-workshop**](./subgraphs/workshops/subgraph-file-data-sources-workshop): Workshop on using File Data Sources in subgraphs, including a fully functional example subgraph that implements File Data Sources and Full Text Search, using the Beanz NFT collection as a case study. Includes slides.
        -   [**subgraph-query-the-graph-workshop**](./subgraphs/workshops/subgraph-query-the-graph-workshop): Workshop on querying subgraphs. Covers creating API keys, sending demo queries, and methods for querying using Vanilla JS, Python (Flask), graph-client, and React Apollo. Includes slides.
