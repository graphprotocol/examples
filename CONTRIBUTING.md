# Contributing to The Graph Example Repositories

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## How to Contribute

- **For any significant change to an example (code, config, or docs):**
  1. **Update the date** at the top of the example's `README.md` in the following format:
     
     ```markdown
     > **Last updated:** Month Year
     ```
     
     For example:
     
     ```markdown
     > **Last updated:** May 2025
     ```
  2. Add a short summary of your change below the date if appropriate.

- **Why?**
  - Our automation script uses this date as the source of truth for the root `README.md` and for users browsing the repo.
  - This keeps "Last updated" dates meaningful and avoids noise from minor or non-functional changes.

- **What counts as a significant change?**
  - Any update to code, configuration, or documentation that affects how the example works or is understood by users.
  - Typos, formatting, or trivial doc tweaks do **not** require a date update.

- **How to update:**
  - Edit the `README.md` in the relevant subfolder.
  - Change the date in the `> **Last updated:** ...` line to the current month and year.

- **Example:**
  - If you update `subgraphs/basic-examples/near/blocks-example`, change the top of its `README.md` to:
    
    ```markdown
    > **Last updated:** May 2025
    ```
